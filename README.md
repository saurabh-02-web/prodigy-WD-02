Stopwatch App

Overview

The Stopwatch App is a simple and intuitive application developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. It is designed to provide users with precise time tracking, including start, stop, and reset functionalities. This project has been an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in app development using HTML CSS JavaScript.

Features

Start/Stop Functionality: Start and stop the stopwatch with a single tap. Reset: Reset the stopwatch to zero. Lap Timing: Record multiple lap times. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.
